 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐬 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞?

 It’s a hands-on learning challenge where you don’t just read concepts, you apply them.
You work on a managed cloud platform using:

⚡ SQL

⚡Python

⚡Spark

There’s also a free Databricks Community Edition, making it easy for anyone to start exploring real datasets.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 (𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐬)?

Most analysts already know SQL and Python — but this challenge helps you:

🔸 Query and analyze data directly in Databricks using SQL

🔸Build dashboards straight from the SQL editor

🔸Understand how data moves through pipelines

🔸Get exposure to Jobs & Pipelines, which are core data engineering concepts

With AI becoming part of almost every data role, understanding data engineering fundamentals significantly boosts an analyst’s career potential.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐦𝐞?

Progress doesn’t happen in a single day, it needs hardwork, consistent practice and passion for learning. 
You don’t truly remember concepts by just reading or watching them
You remember them when you build, break, fix, and rebuild

🧠 What actually happened in these 14 days:
- Spark stopped looking scary
- Delta Lake started making sense
- Bronze, Silver, Gold stopped sounding like jewellery 💍
- SQL dashboards became my comfort zone
- MLflow taught me why tracking experiments matters
- AI (Genie & Mosaic AI) showed up and said:
     “Why type SQL when you can just ask questions?”
